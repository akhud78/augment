## Augmentation
- [How to prepare/augment images for neural network?](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/5224/how-to-prepare-augment-images-for-neural-network)
    - rotation: random with angle between 0째 and 360째 (uniform)
    - translation: random with shift between -10 and 10 pixels (uniform)
    - rescaling: random with scale factor between 1/1.6 and 1.6 (log-uniform)
    - flipping: yes or no (bernoulli)
    - shearing: random with angle between -20째 and 20째 (uniform)
    - stretching: random with stretch factor between 1/1.3 and 1.3 (log-uniform)
